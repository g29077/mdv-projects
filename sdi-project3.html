    <h1>SDI 1309: Richard Pingree</h1>
    <h2>Project 3</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>I chose the theme of putting together a pizza party.  Including who to invite and if they were coming. Also how many pizzas and total slices there are.  I chose this because everyone like pizza.</p>
<p>You may also use this space to explain any elements of your code story that may not be entirely clear.  For example, if your theme is thirteenth century Italian poetry, not everyone may be familiar with that.</p>
<p>Don't forget to replace all of the capitalized elements in this template with your information.  Your term number should be in a <em>yymm</em> format, including the year and the month.</p>
